## activityPub4j
Type safe Java implementation of ActivityStreams and ActivityPub W3C specifications.

Correctly(?) deals with the looseness of the Example input, strict in what it returns.

### Done
- All 159 ActivityStreams examples 'work', a few example modification due to timezone and implicit object type oddities

### To do
- ActivityPub implementation
- Pass ActivityPub test suite
